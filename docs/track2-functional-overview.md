# Overview of Clojure. 

## Clojuredocs 

Clojure has excellent documentation that was put together by Clojure programmers: [Clojuredocs: community-powered documentation and examples repository](https://clojuredocs.org/)

Most of the functions you will be using are listed in [Clojuredocs Quick Reference](https://clojuredocs.org/quickref). The lesson provides links to functions used in each subsection. 

Documentation for each function comes with a list of examples, related functions at the bottom of the page, and even some comments and discussion. Examples have both straightforward common cases and unusual edge cases (if applicable). 

We recommend that you take your time to look through the first few examples - and might even try them out! It is quite common to have several browser tabs open with different function descriptions. 

Clojuredocs are very helpful, please use them! 

## About this lesson

This lesson is intended to be a self-contained introduction to Clojure using fun cipher examples. It walks you through most of the commonly used Clojure functions, gives you an opportunity to write your own through a series of suggested exercises, and finally gives you an example of an encryption to try to break (i.e. attempt to find the key and the decryption) using the tools you have learned. 

Even though the examples are "toy" examples, and not a real-life encryption, the Clojure features and approaches that you learn would be helpful for any data analysis and data processing. 

We encourage you to:

1. Use this lesson as the guide to your learning, not as a rigid set of steps. Take as much time as you want to explore the material, you don't have to finish it or reach any particular milestone. 
2. Try things out. Clojure REPL is a good way to play around with examples. 
3. Ask questions. Mentors are here to answer your questions or explain results that seem confusing or discuss different approaches to a problem. 
4. You might want to work in pairs, especially on the later parts of the lesson.
